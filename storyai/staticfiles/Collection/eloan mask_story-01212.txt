Chapter-3-How to Use Eloan Mask Properly 

Eloan masks are a type of face covering that is designed to protect the wearer from airborne particles and liquid that could contaminate the face. They are particularly useful in preventing the spread of diseases and infections. However, for these masks to be effective, they must be worn correctly. Here is a detailed guide on how to use an Eloan mask properly.

Before you put on the mask, it is important to ensure that your hands are clean. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, you can use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. This is to prevent any germs on your hands from contaminating the mask.

Once your hands are clean, pick up the mask by the ear loops or ties. Do not touch the inside of the mask, as this is the part that will be in contact with your face. If the mask has a metallic strip, this should be at the top. The metallic strip is designed to be molded over the bridge of your nose for a better fit.

Hold the mask by the ear loops and place a loop around each ear. If the mask has ties, bring the mask to nose level and secure the top ties in a bow at the crown of your head. Then secure the bottom ties in a bow at the nape of your neck. 

Once the mask is on, use your fingers to mold or pinch the metallic strip so that it fits snugly over the bridge of your nose. The mask should cover your nose, mouth, and chin. Make sure there are no gaps between your face and the mask. 

Avoid touching the mask while you are wearing it. If you do touch it, wash your hands or use hand sanitizer immediately. 

When it is time to remove the mask, do not touch the front of the mask, as it may be contaminated. Instead, remove it by the ear loops or ties. If the mask has ear loops, hold both of the ear loops and gently lift and remove the mask. If it has ties, untie the bottom bow first then the top one, and gently pull the mask away from your face.

After removing the mask, dispose of it in a closed bin immediately if it is a disposable mask. If it is a reusable mask, wash it according to the manufacturer's instructions. After handling the mask, wash your hands or use hand sanitizer.

Remember, masks are effective only when used in combination with frequent hand-cleaning with soap and water or hand sanitizer. Also, you should replace the mask with a new one as soon as it is damp and do not re-use single-use masks.

In conclusion, wearing an Eloan mask properly is crucial in preventing the spread of diseases and infections. It is not enough to just wear a mask; you must wear it correctly for it to be effective. This involves ensuring your hands are clean before handling the mask, putting it on and removing it correctly, and cleaning your hands after handling it. By following these steps, you can protect yourself and others from potential health risks.
